          <p>
            This course is advanced interaction design course the focuses on
            designing interactive applications for emerging mobile and
            context-aware technologies. It is a studio-based coursed, consisting
            largely of a seminar-long group project with multiple milestones,
            and is supplemented by readings and discussion relevant to the topic.
            Class meetings consist of brief lectures to introduce and frame
            course concepts, design methods, and technical tools; discussion of
            readings; in-class design exercises; and group work/lab time.

          <h2>About the Problem</h2>
          <p>
            Architecture students at the University of Michigan College of
            Architecture and Urban Planning (TCAUP) are busy and hard-working,
            spending much of their time doing work in the studio. As they spend
            time working in the studio, many students feel that their creativity
            is stifled because of the sterile environment. They also find wish that
            there were environmental changes throughout the day to help
            stimulate them, and make their work time more enjoyable. Additionally,
            while they are extremely busy, they still find it important to take
            breaks throughout the day to stay focused and productive.

        <h2>Research & Findings</h2>
        <p>
          To better understand our target population, we used two research
          methods: a diary study, and a survey. This gave us the benefit of both
          depth and breath, by allowing us to get specific, detailed information
          about the day-to-day life from a few people, and general information
          from many people. Because no one on our team is a member of our target
          population, we thought having both depth and breadth in our study was
          an essential piece in allowing us to understand our population.
        </p>
        <p>
          After completing our research, we created a low fidelity prototype
          and conducted user enactments with several architecture students.
          Getting feedback from architecture students showed us that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Architecture students appreciate having nature scenes while they work
          </li>
          <li>
            Architecture students do not want any additional decisions added to
            their day
          </li>
          <li>
            Over long periods spent working in the studio, architecture students
            require strategic breaks refresh their minds
          </li>
          <li>
            Architecture students would be interested in reflecting on their
            hard work to gain a sense of satisfaction
          </li>
          <li>
            Architecture students want an individualized product
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Based on our research and user enactments, we distilled our findings
          down into 3 key insights:

              The architecture program is very stressful, and students spend an
              incredible amount of time in the studio.

        <h2>Prototype</h2>
        <p>
          The result of our research, key findings, and design criteria was
          NatureFrame: a small, touchscreen display that students can put on
          their desk. There are 3 key features of the NatureFrame:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Nature scenes that change throughout the day based on hours
              spent in studio and number of breaks taken, creating a changing
              environment for students as they spend their days working in
              the studio.
            </li>
            <li>
              An automated system that turns on and off without user input
              based on the Bluetooth connection between the NatureFrame and
              the user's cell phone.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reminders to take breaks at an interval set by the user (for
              example, a 10 minute break for every hour of work). Break ideas
              provided by the NatureFrame include: taking a walk, chatting with
              friends, or completing one of the meditation sessions built into
              the product. If the user ignores the reminder, NatureFrame will
              automatically remind them again.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Our prototype includes a computer monitor to represent the
          NatureFrame's touchscreen display, a laptop to represent the
          internal processor (controlled by a wizard when the user interacts
          with the "touchscreen" display), and a Bluetooth Beacon to represent
          the Bluetooth connection between the NatureFrame and the user's cell
          phone. We also used nature animations and an Electron app to
          prototype the front end display of the NatureFrame.
        </p>
        <p>
          In our ideal system, the NatureFrame will be composed of a
          touchscreen display with integrated processor, as opposed to the
          separate display and processor used in our prototype. Additionally,
          the NatureFrame would pair directly with the Bluetooth of the user's
          phone
