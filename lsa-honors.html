          <h2>SI 622: Needs Assessment and Usability Evaluation</h2>
          <p>
            SI 622 covers the key concepts of evaluation, and a variety of methods
            used to determine the goals of a system or service: performing
            organizational analysis; assessing task/technology or service fit;
            determining ease of learning a new or existing system/service;
            determining ease of use; assessing aspects of performance; and
            evaluating system success in accomplishing the user/organizational goals.
            Methods include observation, surveys, interviews, heuristic evaluation,
            and usability tests.

          <h2>About the Client</h2>
          <p>
            The LSA Honors program is a department within the College of Literature,
            Science and the Arts at the University of Michigan. This department
            maintains the LSA Honors website, which contains information for
            prospective students, current students, faculty and staff, and alumni
            and friends. Because they are a department within LSA, the Honors
            Program is required to use the Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) content
            management system, in addition to using the standard website template for
            all LSA departments. This poses some difficulties because it means the
            Honors Program has limited ability to make changes to their website.

          <h2>Findings</h2>
          <p>
            One of the main concerns our stakeholders had about the LSA Honors
            website is that it is hard for users to find the information they are
            looking for. After learning this, we determined that we should focus
            our research on the information architecture and information hierarchy
            present within the LSA Honors website.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to our stakeholders, we also interviewed five current
            LSA Honors students to get their thoughts about the website. Based on
            these interviews, we learned these students did have difficulty
            finding information, mainly due to text-heavy pages and unclear
            navigation. We used the demographic information and opinions of our
            interviewees to create three personas for the LSA Honors website: Josh,
            a not particularily tech-savvy junior; Melanie, a sophomore who is
            very involved in the Honors community, and Honors events; and Tom,
            a freshman who is interested in creating a road map for his next four
            years in the LSA Honors Program.
          </p>
          <p>
            After completing our personas, we moved on to comparative analysis -
            looking at the Michigan State Honors Program (Direct Comparison), the
            Michigan Community Scholars Program (Indirect Comparison), the Sweetland
            Writing Center (Parallel Comparison), the University of Michigan School
            of Information (Parallel Comparison), and the Michigan Secretary of
            State (Analogous Comparison). Examining these websites gave us some
            ideas to for improvements to the LSA Honors website. We also completed
            a Heuristic Analysis, which showed a few minor, but no major, heuristic
            issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to hear from a greater range of people, we also
            created a survey for current LSA Honors Students.
            The results of our survey supported the findings of our interviews -
            studnets think that the LSA honors website can be difficult to navigate
            when searching for information. Our usabilitiy tests, conducted with a mix
            of current and non-LSA Honors students, showed similar results.

        <h2>Updated Project Goal</h2>
        <p class="goal">
          Create recommendations to help the LSA Honors website improve their <br/>
          <b>information architecture</b> and <b>information hierarchy</b>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="full prototypes">
        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
        <p>
          Based on the results of our research, we came up with a few key
          recommendations. First, we suggested that the terminology used on the
          website - like page titles - should give users and idea about what
          information they can expect to find on each page. We also suggested
          that the navigation should group similar items together,
          in order to make it easier to find. Finally, adding more media to
          pages when possible would help people enjoy using the LSA Honors
          website more. These small changes have the
          potential to make the LSA Honors website much easier to navigate and
          parse through, and are two changes that the Honors Program has
          the capability to change within the AEM system.
