            The User Experience Design Clinic program provides the opportunity
            for students to act as UX/UI design consultants working on real-world,
            fast-paced projects from the University of Michigan and regional
            communities within a semester's framework. Students will work
            collaboratively in interdisciplinary teams and will be responsible
            for nurturing creative team dynamics, communicating with clients and
            managing the progress of projects, while learning and receiving
            guidance from mentors and team members with more or unique experiences.
          </p>
          <strong>About the client</strong>
          <p>
            Sage &amp; Grace is a website and concierge service that educates
            and empowers grieving families to better, and more affordably,
            navigate the complications and stress of the American funeral planning
            process. Many consumers start their funeral planning process by going
            online, but the disparity and inferiority of the information available
            online results in misinformation, confusion, and stress. By using the
            Sage &amp; Grace online platform that clearly organizes information
            and tailors funeral planning options based on consumer needs, consumers
            will be able to make better informed decisions throughout the process.
          </p>
          <strong>Project Goal</strong>
          <p>
            Find trustworthy and simple way to help novices conquer the complexity
            in finding a suitable funeral home.

          </div>
          <p>
            As an incoming graduate student at the University of Michigan,
            it can be difficult to find housing on or around campus. Because
            many graduate students are coming from places outside the state
            of Michigan, or even outside the United States, they may not be
            able come to Ann Arbor to visit potential apartments, and may
            have to conduct their housing search from afar. This can make
            it more difficult to find a suitable living arrangement.
            Additionally, graduate students may be interested in sharing
            housing with one or more roommates to cut down on costs, but
            may not know any other students with whom they could live,
            especially if they are incoming first year students. Even for
            returning students who may be looking to move to a different
            apartment, the process can be difficult because there is not
            necessarily one centralized place to look for apartment listings.
            These factors can make the housing search stressful for graduate
            students. I would like to design a technical intervention to
            help the University of Michigan graduate student population
            more easily find housing and/or roommates in Ann Arbor.

            In order to differentiate my app from competitors like Craigslist
            and PadMapper, I decided to make the primary focus searching for and
            matching with compatible roommates rather than finding an apartment.

            Any product - whether a website, a technological system, or an
            electronically mediated service - benefits from evaluation before,
            during, and after the development cycle. Too often, the people who
            use a product cannot find what they want or accomplish what they need
            to do. Products are more successful when they are developed through
            a process that identifies how the products will be used, elicits
            input from potential users, and watches how the product function in
            real time with real users. This course provides a hands--on introduction
            to methods used throughout the entire evaluation process--from identifying
            the goals of the product, picturing who will use it, engaging users
            through a variety of formative evaluation techniques, and confirming
            a product's function through usability testing and summative evaluation.
            Specific methods include personas and scenarios, competitive analysis,
            observation, surveys, interviews, data analysis, heuristic evaluation,
            usability testing, and task analysis. Students will work on group projects
            that apply these techniques to real products in use or development.

          <p>
            Real Time Farms is devoted to the collaborative efforts between restaurants,
            farmers markets, farmers, and consumers to post information about food and
            ingredients online. The Real Time Farms website consists of 3 major pages:
            food, farmers markets, and eateries. Each of these options can be accessed
            via a menu bar at the top of the site or the map interface on the home page.
            Within these pages, visitors to the site can find food, farms, markets,
            and restaurants located anywhere in the world, though a majority of
            establishments are located in the United States. The website also includes
            features that enable site visitors to search for individual farms, markets
            and restaurants, and which ingredients these establishments use and where
            they have come from.

            As the final project for SI 422: Evaluation of Systems and Services, I,
            along with a team of four others, created a report on the Real Time Farms
            website that looked at the usability of the site. Our report included our
            own thoughts, as well as findings obtained through interviews and testing
            with others who were unfamiliar with the site.
