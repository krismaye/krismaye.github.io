          <h2>SI 582: Introduction to Interaction Design</h2>
          <p>
            SI 582 provides students with a hands-on introduction to interaction
            design. The course will focuses on design methods and design thinking,
            and allows students to develop their design sensibilities and practical
            skills through a series of design exercises. The course covers
            individual and group ideation techniques; sketching on paper and
            using software tools; prototyping approaches, tools, and techniques;
            and contemporary perspectives on interaction design for common platforms
            (e.g., web, desktop, tablet, mobile, and beyond).

          <h2>About the Problem</h2>
          <p>
            As an incoming graduate student at the University of Michigan, it can
            be difficult to find housing near campus. Because many graduate
            students are coming from places outside the state of Michigan, or even
            outside the United States, they may not be able come to Ann Arbor to
            visit potential apartments, and may have to conduct their housing search
            from afar. This can make it more difficult to find a suitable living
            arrangement. Additionally, graduate students may be interested in sharing
            housing with one or more roommates to cut down on costs, but may not
            know any other students with whom they could live. Even for returning
            students who may be looking to move to a new apartment, the process
            can be difficult because there is no centralized place to look for apartment
            listings. These factors can make the housing search stressful for graduate students.

        <h2>Research &amp; Feature Definition</h2>
        <p>
          In interviewing several of my peers about their housing searches, I
          learned that most of them felt the process was overly complicated.
          One person in particular said that she ended up moving into a house
          with other people she didn't know, because she felt overwhelmed with
          the thought of trying to find the perfect roommate. My interviewees also
          noted that they thought their housing searches would have been easier
          if there had been one place they could have found all of the information
          they needed; and that during their searches, they wanted to have more
          information about apartments (especially pictures or videos). Another
          interviewee also noted that she was intimidated by talking to landlords
          on the phone, and wanted to be able to communicate with them via email.
          Based on these interviews, I decided that some key features of my solution
          should be: providing consolidated information about all types of housing
          options (both on- and off-campus), providing details about each property
          (especially pictures/video when possible), allowing users to directly
          email landlords from within the system, and allowing users to match with
          people to find their "perfect" roommate(s).
        </p>
        <p>
          After solidifying these features, I brainstormed with some other
          classmates about what shape my solution could take. In creating a
          matching system for roommates, we determined that it would be helpful
          to focus on quantitative aspects (such as "I wake up early", or "I
          like my apartment to be quiet"), since this would make it easier for
          people to quickly understand the content of other users' profiles.
          We also talked about how this app could differentiate itself from other
          solutions on the market (like Craigslist, or individual property
          managmement company websites). Although they are very fragmented,
          there are currently several solutions for finding housing in Ann Arbor,
          but none for finding roommates. Because of this, I decided that the
          differentiating feature of my app should be that it focuses on
          roommates first, and then housing.

        <h2>Updated Project Goal</h2>
        <p class="goal">
          Design an <b>app</b> to help graduate students match with <br/>
          <b>ideal roommates</b> and <b>share</b> their housing search.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="full prototypes">
        <h2>Prototypes</h2>
        <p>
          Having decided that the focus of my app would be finding roommates, I
          looked at some possible user flows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In the first scenario, users would see a housing map first, from which
            they could decide which apartment they were most interested in. From
            there, they would be able to search for the appropriate amount of
            roommates based on the apartment they selected.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the second scenario, I had users match with roommates
            first, before moving on to the map of apartment listings.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Because the second scenario was more focused on roommate finding, I chose to
          use that workflow for my app. At this point, I began to flesh out more
          of the details. Early on, I wondered if my app should allow users to
          access some app content without having to create an account. However,
          I decided to create more privacy by requiring users to create an account
          before using any features of the app. Additionally, since the matching
          portion of the app would work by matching people based on their individual
          characteristics, having an account was essential, as it allowed
          users to fill out and save their characteristics and preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the features and workflow through my app determined, I created the
          first iteration of my paper prototype. Each of the screens took the
          user through the process of:
        </p>
         <ol>
           <li>creating their account,</li>
           <li>viewing their matches,</li>
           <li>sending roommate requests, and</li>
           <li>finding apartments.</li>
         </ol>
         <p class="above-image">
           After testing my first paper prototype with some of my classmates, I
           realized that there were some things that, while seeming intuitive
           to me, were not intuitive to others. For example, on the roommate
           detail page, I had nested two features, "favorite" and "send roommate
           request", within a single heart-shaped button; my tester told me
           that she didn't want to press it, because she wasn't sure what would
           happen. So, in my second prototype, I separated the two buttons and
           gave them labels to ensure that each button's function would be clear.
           Another thing that came up when testing my first prototype was that
           while people might be quiet, or messy, they might not necessarily
           care whether their roommate had similar characteristics (especially
           for the "night owl" vs. "early bird" characteristic). Because of this,
           I decided to add a toggle under each characteristic where the user
           could pick whether or not it was important that their roommates shared
           this quality with them. I also realized that I had built my paper
           prototype to work only if the user followed my intended workflow,
           and hadn't included a menu to let them move around to different screens
           on their own; this important feature was added in later iterations.

         </div>
         <p>
  	        After improving my initial paper prototype, I moved on to a digital
            prototype. Using Adobe XD, I created each of my screens and linked
            them together using interactions. To use my app, users first create
            an account where they can fill out characteristics about themselves,
            like whether they are neat or messy, loud or quiet, etc. They can also
            indicate how important each of these characteristics are to them. After
            filling out their profile, users are taken to a screen with a list of
            matches ordered by how close they are to the user's preferences. From
            this list, they can view the profiles of any of their matches and
            either add the match to their favorites list (to save it for later),
            or send a roommate request to the match. After looking at roommates,
            users can view a screen with a map of apartment listings. When they
            first visit the map, they can see all apartment listings, but there
            are a variety of filters (price, number of bedrooms, neighborhood,
            etc.) that can be used to filter the results to better meet the needs
            of each user. Clicking on any of the pins on the map opens a new
            screen with the detail for the individual listing, where the user
            can add an apartment to their favorites list, which is later shared
            with anyone who accepts their roommate request. From the favorites
            list, users can contact landlords for any of their favorite apartments
            by email or phone.
