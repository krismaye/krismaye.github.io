        <h2>About the Population &amp; Problem</h2>
        <p>
          As an incoming graduate student at the University of Michigan, it can
          be difficult to find housing near campus. Because many graduate
          students are coming from places outside the state of Michigan, or even
          outside the United States, they may not be able come to Ann Arbor to
          visit potential apartments, and may have to conduct their housing
          search remotely. This can make it more difficult to find a suitable
          living arrangement. Additionally, graduate students may be interested
          in sharing housing with roommates to share costs, but may not know any
          other students with whom they could live. Even for returning students
          looking to move to a new apartment, the process can be difficult
          because there is no centralized place to look for apartment listings.
          These factors can make the housing search tedious and stressful.

        <h2>Research &amp; Feature Definition</h2>
        <p>
          In interviewing several of my peers about their housing searches, I
          learned that most of them felt the process was overly complicated.
          One student in particular said that she ended up moving into a house
          with people she didn't know because she felt overwhelmed with the
          thought of trying to find the perfect roommate. My interviewees
          also noted that they thought their housing searches would have been
          easier if there had been one place they could have found all of the
          information they needed; and that during their searches, they wanted
          to have more information about apartments (especially pictures or
          videos). Another interviewee also noted that she was intimidated by
          talking to landlords on the phone, and wanted to be able to
          communicate via email instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on these interviews, I decided that some key features of my
          solution should be:
          <ul>
            <li>
              providing consolidated information about all types of housing
              options (both on- and off-campus),
            </li>
            <li>
              providing details about each property (especially pictures/video
              when possible),
            </li>
            <li>
              allowing users to directly email landlords from within the system,
              and
            </li>
            <li>
              allowing users to match with people to find their "perfect"
              roommate(s).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          After solidifying these features, I brainstormed with classmates to
          think about what shape my solution could take. In creating a matching
          system for roommates, we determined that it would be helpful to focus
          on quantitative aspects (such as "I wake up early", or "I like my
          apartment to be quiet"), since this would make it easier for people
          to quickly understand the content of other users' profiles.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also talked about how this app could differentiate itself from
          other solutions on the market (like Craigslist, or individual property
          managmement company websites). Although fragmented, there are
          currently several solutions for finding housing in Ann Arbor, but none
          for finding roommates. Because of this, I decided that the
          differentiating feature of my app should be that it focuses on
          roommates first, and then housing.

        <h2>Prototypes</h2>
        <p>
          Having decided that the focus of my app would be finding roommates, I
          looked at some possible user flows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In the first scenario, users would see a housing map first, from
            which they could decide which apartment they were most interested
            in. From there, they would be able to search for the appropriate
            amount of roommates based on the apartment they selected.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the second scenario, I had users match with roommates
            first, before moving on to the map of apartment listings.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Because the second scenario put the emphasis on finding a roommate, I
          chose to use that workflow for my app. At this point, I fleshed out
          more details. Early on, I wondered if my app should allow users to
          access some app content without having to create an account. However,
          I decided to create more privacy by requiring users to create an
          account before using any features of the app. Additionally, since the
          matching portion of the app would work by matching people based on
          their individual characteristics, having an account was essential, as
          it allowed users to fill out and save their characteristics and
          preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the features and workflow through my app determined, I created
          the first iteration of my paper prototype. Each of the screens took
          the user through the process of:
        </p>
         <ol>
           <li>creating their account,</li>
           <li>viewing their matches,</li>
           <li>sending roommate requests, and</li>
           <li>finding apartments.</li>
         </ol>

         <p>
           After testing my first paper prototype, I realized that there were
           some things that, while intuitive to me, were not intuitive to others.
           For example, on the roommate detail page, I had nested two features,
           "favorite" and "send roommate request", within a single heart-shaped
           button; my tester told me hat she didn't want to press it, because
           she wasn't sure what would happen. So, in my second prototype, I
           separated and labeled the two buttons to ensure that the function of
           each would be clear.
         </p>
         <p class="above-image">
           Another thing that came up when testing my first prototype was that
           while people might be quiet, or messy, they might not necessarily
           care whether their roommate had similar characteristics. Because of
           this, I decided to add a toggle under each characteristic where the
           user could pick whether or not it was important that their roommates
           shared this quality with them.

    	        After improving my initial paper prototype, I moved on to a digital
              prototype. Using Adobe XD, I created each of my screens and linked
              them together using interactions. To use my app, users first create
              an account where they can fill out characteristics about themselves,
              like whether they are neat or messy, loud or quiet, etc. They can
              also indicate how important each of these characteristics are to
              them. After filling out their profile, users are taken to a screen
              with a list of matches ordered by how close they are to the user's
              preferences.
            </p>
            <p>
              From their matches list, users can view the profiles of any of the
              matches and either add the match to their favorites list to save it
              for later, or send a roommate request to the match. After looking at
              roommates, users can view a screen with a map of apartment listings.
              When they first visit the map, they can see all apartment listings,
              but there are a variety of filters (price, number of bedrooms,
              neighborhood, etc.) that can be used to filter the results. Clicking
              on any of the pins on the map opens a new screen with the detail for
              the individual listing, where the user can add an apartment to their
              favorites list, which is later shared with anyone who accepts their
              roommate request. From the favorites list, users can contact
              landlords for any of their favorite apartments by email or phone.
